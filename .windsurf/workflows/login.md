On login page we need to persist the content of docmost instance url and username values in localstorage.
The problem at present is when we want to copy the credentials from password manager, every time the clipper window is loosing focus it disapears and data from input fields is lost.
At present user in one go needs to fill all the fields and click connect button - which is not user friendly.

We need to modify the login page to persist the content of docmost instance url and username values in localstorage.
